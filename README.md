This project aims to enhance the engagement and interest in the teaching process. Especially for those who work in private educational organizations, how to make learning entertaining for kids is not just about a teacher's competence, but also about the happiness of those tired children.  
So how to make this possible? Game. No one dislikes playing games, right?(except some freaks) If we can make the class a reality competitive game, children will participate in learning spontaneously.  
However, a consequent problem lies in our way, how to design an approperiate game balancing seriousness and fun? Here's my idea.

# Principles
Before designing a game serving as a teaching tool, you should rethink whether you really need it. GT(Game Teaching) is not as easy and universal as you imagine. Some people don't buy it, such as adult students or even students who reach to you just for some instant help.  
What's more, GT doesn't merely mean add gaming elements in class, for example, you design a game and let them play, with you standing there like an outsider. GT is a process in which teachers interact with students, and they are all equally gamers. Standing there like a farmer tossing grain to his chickens hardly reflects the poise of a teacher.    
When contriving a game-involved class, keep these rules in mind:
1. Tailor everything to your target students
2. You are a gamer too
3. Aim to elicit benevolent envy rather than malicious competition
4. Easier-to-understand rules, quicker adaptation by students
5. Both positive and negative feedback matter, stimulation is the soul of any game
6. Step into others' shoes to evaluate your work

# Teaching life cycle
A whole teaching life cycle should contain three principle steps.  
Pre-Leaning -> Learning -> Review  
Our constitution should base on the whole teaching cycle to make sure that students can equally have the same experience everytime he approaches our influence region.

# Elements of a game
A matured game consists of some fundamental components.
## Gameplay
Gameplay is how to play the game and often called rules of a game. Rules are vital to constrain gamers' behavior and this is the basement of your justice and disparity.
## Rewards
Rewards are elements by which motive gamers to participate in gaming. We often use currency as a way of rewarding.
## Competition
Competition keeps people on edge, pushing them to reach their full potential. Stimulation makes game sustainable.
## Challenges
Hard work is daunting but when you overcome it, the sense of achievement deserves all struggle.
## Tactics
There is not just one road to Rome. As mentioned above, we should tailor game to different students. The path to victory and method of striving diverge from top students and those who lag behind. It's better to make everyone can benefit from stimulation system.
